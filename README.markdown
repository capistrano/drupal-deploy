# Capistrano::DrupalDeploy

Deploy [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) with [Capistrano v3](http://capistranorb.com/). This gem is a pluging for capistrano that provide a number of tasks specific to Drupal. For the moment support only Drupal 7.

If you are new to capistrano check the [Capistrano 3 documentation](http://capistranorb.com/).

## Installation
[gems](http://rubygems.org) must be installed on your system first.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
group :development do
    gem 'capistrano-drupal-deploy', '~> 0.0.2'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec cap install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capistrano-drupal-deploy
    $ cap install

## Usage	

Require the module in your `Capfile`:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/drupal-deploy'
# Composer is needed to install drush on the server
require 'capistrano/composer'
```

### Configuration

Edit `config/deploy.rb` to set the global parameters. You should at least edit your app_name and your repo_url.

```ruby
 set :application, 'my app name'
 set :repo_url, 'git@example.com:me/my_repo.git'
```

*Capistrano drupal deploy* makes the following configuration variables available

```ruby
# Path to the drupal directory, default to app.
set :app_path,        "app"
```

Drupal need settings.php and, files and private-files shared accross deploy

```ruby
# Link file settings.php
set :linked_files, fetch(:linked_files, []).push('app/sites/default/settings.php')

# Link dirs files and private-files
set :linked_dirs, fetch(:linked_dirs, []).push('app/sites/default/files', 'private-files')
```


Composer and drush need to be mapped

```ruby
# Remove default composer install task on deploy:updated
Rake::Task['deploy:updated'].prerequisites.delete('composer:install')

# Map composer and drush commands
# NOTE: If stage have different deploy_to
# you have to copy those line for each <stage_name>.rb
# See https://github.com/capistrano/composer/issues/22
SSHKit.config.command_map[:composer] = "#{shared_path.join("composer.phar")}"
SSHKit.config.command_map[:drush] = "#{shared_path.join("vendor/bin/drush")}"
```
	
Configure each stage in config/deploy/<stage_name>.rb. Overwrite global settings if needed.

```ruby
# server-based syntax
# ======================
# Defines a single server with a list of roles and multiple properties.
# You can define all roles on a single server, or split them:

# server 'example.com', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{app db web}, my_property: :my_value

# overwrite deploy_to
set :deploy_to, '/var/www/stage_name/my_app'

# set a branch for this release
set :branch, 'dev'
```

## Deployment

Run deploy

	$ cap <stage_name> deploy

After a couple of commands, it will fail with this error:

	Finished in 0.067 seconds with exit status 1 (failed).
	ERROR linked file /var/www/stage_name/my_app/shared/app/sites/default/settings.php does not exist on staging.mysite.com
	
As expected, Capistrano has been told to link your settings.php file, but it canâ€™t find it on the server where it expects. We need to manually upload that file now. If we look at the app directory on our server, it now contains two folders releases and shared. Inside of the shared directory you will find a app/sites/default directory. You will need to create your settings.php file into that directory.

On the server your webserver user (eg. www-data) need to has the right to write in

	/var/www/stage_name/my_app/shared/app/sites/default/files
	/var/www/stage_name/my_app/shared/private-files

Once this is done, try and deploy again. If everything goes well, Capistrano will clone your app from your repository and work the rest.

Now, every time you want to deploy your app

	$ cap deploy

Some command use drush. To install drush on your server

	$ cap composer:install_executable
	$ cap drush:install


If you want to deploy your app and also revert features, clear cache

	$ cap deploy:full
	
And if some troubles occur, just launch the rollback command to return to the previous release.

	$ cap deploy:rollback


You should then be able to proceed as you would usually, you may want to familiarise yourself with the truncated list of tasks, you can get a full list with:

    $ cap -T
    
This show a list of all avaible commands:

    
	cap composer:install               # Install the project dependencies via Composer
